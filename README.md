In this game the dealer is dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks.The details given below:
